I have removed any forms of punctuation with the isalpha() method as this both removes any punctuation and numbers from the process. Numbers are not relevant to the task at hand as I am required to search for commonly used words. Punctuation can cause a variety of issues when trying to process a corpus, for example when using a comma after a word like this: 'hello,' the comma will be noted and counted as a comma i.e ',' with many forms of punctuation being used, these can quickly add up and will interfere with results by being more commonly used than most words.\n","\n",">I decided to remove the use of any words used less than twice to create an effect of words used several times.

(e.g., from NLTK).  Make sure you discuss the results.\n","> I have used a confusion matrix to produce a visual comparison of the performance between my word list classifier and a Naive Bayes classifier.\n","\n","> Accuracy is the percentage of predictions a classifier gets correct. The accuracy of Naive Bayes Classifier classifier is around 93%  (0.932475884244373) and the accuracy of Word List Classifier classifier is around 56% (0.5612718828152912) this shows that the accuracy of the NB classifier was significantly higher.  \n","\n",">The F1 score can be described as an average of the precision and recall, where an F1 score reaches its best value at 1 and worst score at 0.

Which is vital in real-life classifications.\n","\n",">Recall is the number of correct results divided by the number of results that should have been returned. The recall of the WL classifier isn't as drastic a difference compared to accuracy and f1 score.

Recall is important when the cost of false negatives is high so overall both classifiers were effective for recall.\n","\n",">To conclude, it is clear the NB classifier is the better of the classifiers. This is because the NB classifier is alot more thorough and efficient than the simple classifier as it uses priors, and conds. It also uses set words, like the WL classifier. Despite the NB being 'Naive' it just isnt as simple as the WL classifier, so it does a more in depth classification process."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"LGDXaVDqOSfY"},"source":["4) Design and carry out an experiment into the impact of the amount of training data on each of these classifiers.
